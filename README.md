# About the Project
StudyPod is a webapp that promotes productivity by rewarding users with upgrades for a virtual pet when they complete tasks! Each overarching goal, like a group project or studying for an exam, is given a "Gus". Gus is our team's fierce and powerful mascot (see above). As teammates add and complete tasks, they can level up their Gus by giving him accessories, room decor, and more! StudyPod will motivate users and help them hold each other accountable, all while treating Gus with the love and care he deserves.
